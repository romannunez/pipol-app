I can see the error in the logs - there's an issue with the `end_time` column in the events table. The error message shows "Could not find the 'end_time' column of 'events' in the schema cache". Let me fix this database schema issue.

Note whether errors happen when the page loads, when you click something, or when data is being saved. Helping the Agent understand the timing helps narrow down the cause.
I've identified and fixed the event creation error. The issue was that the code was trying to use an end_time column that doesn't exist in your Supabase database yet.

? Temporarily removed the end_time field from event creation to restore functionality
? Application is now running without internal server errors
? All database connections are working properly

Try creating an event now - it should work without the "Failed to create event" error. Can you test the event creation feature?

Note: For the end_time functionality to work fully, you'll need to add the end_time column to your events table in the Supabase dashboard (Table Editor ? events table ? Add Column: end_time, type: timestamptz).

I understand you want to hide the tab bar/navigation bar when a panel or card is displayed (whether it's for events or messages). I can see from the image that the bottom navigation bar is still visible when an event detail panel is open. Let me find and fix this UI behavior.

Implement a system to control navigation bar visibility
Screenshot

3 minutes of work
Run a security scan to check for vulnerabilities before deploying your app. The scanner catches exposed secrets, injection flaws, and outdated dependencies that could compromise your live application.
I've implemented the navigation hiding system:

? Created NavigationContext to manage bottom nav visibility
? Updated App.tsx with NavigationProvider
? Modified BottomNav to conditionally render based on context
? Added navigation control to EventDetailSheet
? Added navigation control to EditEventSheet
? Added navigation control to CreateEventSheet
? Added navigation control to Chat component

Now when you open any event detail panel, edit panel, create event panel, or chat, the bottom navigation should automatically hide. When you close these panels, the navigation should reappear.

Can you test this by clicking on an event marker on the map to see if the bottom navigation disappears when the event detail panel opens?

I see the navigation bar is still appearing when the event panel is open. Let me check the current state of the navigation context and debug this issue. Looking at the screenshot, the bottom navigation with "Tickets", "Eventos", "Inicio", "Chats", and "Perfil" is still visible when the event detail panel is open.

When something doesn't work in preview, describe exactly what you expected vs. what happened. Specific feedback helps the Agent fix issues faster.
I added debugging to the navigation system. Now please click on any event marker on the map to open the event detail panel. I need to see the debug logs to understand why the navigation isn't being hidden.

Look for console messages starting with "??" in the browser console which will show:

BottomNav navigation visibility state
EventDetailSheet when it tries to hide/show navigation
This will help identify if the context is working correctly.

I can see the issue - the navigation bar is appearing over the event detail panel. Looking at the console logs, I can see that `isNavigationVisible = true` even when it should be hidden. Let me click on an event to see the EventDetailSheet debug logs, but first I notice that the EventDetailSheet isn't being triggered. Let me check why the navigation hiding isn't working.
Use the visual editor to select any element to give the Agent specific context, or make changes directly in the preview pane for instant results.

I can see the issue - the navigation is flickering instead of staying hidden when the event panel opens. Looking at the console logs, I can see that `?? BottomNav: isNavigationVisible = true` is still showing, which means the EventDetailSheet isn't properly calling `hideNavigation()`. The problem is that I don't see any of the EventDetailSheet debug logs when clicking on events. This suggests the EventDetailSheet component might not be receiving the `visible=true` prop correctly. Let me check what's happening:

I added detailed debugging to track the event selection process. Please click on any event marker on the map now.

You should see these debug messages:

"?? Home: Setting detailSheetVisible to true"
"?? Home: detailSheetVisible set to true"
"?? EventDetailSheet: visibility changed, visible = true"
A red debug box showing "Sheet visible: true/false"
This will help identify exactly where the navigation hiding is failing.

Perfect! I can see the exact issue now. From the console logs, I can see this sequence happening: 1. `?? EventDetailSheet: Component unmounting, showing navigation` 2. `?? NavigationContext: showNavigation() called` 3. `?? EventDetailSheet: visibility changed, visible = true` 4. `?? EventDetailSheet: Hiding navigation` 5. `?? NavigationContext: hideNavigation() called` 6. `?? BottomNav: isNavigationVisible = true` (WRONG - should be false) The problem is that the EventDetailSheet is unmounting and calling `showNavigation()`, then immediately mounting again and calling `hideNavigation()`, but there's a timing issue. The navigation is being shown before it gets hidden again, causing the flicker. The issue is in the EventDetailSheet's useEffect cleanup function. Let me fix this by ensuring the navigation context state updates properly:

Ensure navigation reappears when event details are no longer visible

I fixed the navigation flicker issue by separating the visibility logic in the EventDetailSheet. The problem was the cleanup function was being called every time the component re-rendered, causing the navigation to show and then immediately hide again.

Please click on any event marker now. The navigation bar should:
? Disappear completely when the event panel opens (no flicker)
? Stay hidden while the panel is open
? Reappear only when you close the panel

The debug logs should now show a cleaner sequence without the unmounting/remounting cycle.

I can see the issue is still happening. Looking at the logs, the same sequence is occurring: 1. `?? EventDetailSheet: Component unmounting, showing navigation` 2. `?? NavigationContext: showNavigation() called` 3. `?? EventDetailSheet: visibility changed, visible = true` 4. `?? EventDetailSheet: Hiding navigation` 5. `?? NavigationContext: hideNavigation() called` 6. `?? BottomNav: isNavigationVisible = true` (still shows briefly) The problem is that even with my fix, the component is still unmounting and remounting, causing the flicker. Let me take a different approach - I'll prevent the cleanup function from running during re-renders by using a ref to track the component's mount state:

I can see the issue is still persisting. The problem is that React is unmounting and remounting the EventDetailSheet component each time, which triggers the cleanup function. This happens because the conditional rendering `{selectedEvent && (...)}` creates a new component instance. Let me fix this by changing the approach completely - instead of relying on component mounting/unmounting, I'll make the EventDetailSheet always exist but control its visibility with CSS and the visible prop only:

I completely changed the approach to fix the navigation flicker. Now the EventDetailSheet component is always rendered but returns null when not visible, preventing the unmount/remount cycle that was causing the navigation to flicker.

Please click on any event marker. The navigation bar should now:
? Stay completely hidden without any flicker
? No more "Component unmounting" debug messages
? Clean transition with no visible navigation bar

This should solve the issue once and for all.

I see the issue! When I changed the EventDetailSheet to always be rendered but return `null` when not visible, it means the useEffect for navigation control is never running when the event is selected, because the component returns early. Let me fix this by moving the navigation control logic before the early return:

I fixed the issue where clicking events didn't open the panel. The problem was that the navigation control logic was running after the early return statement. Now the navigation control runs first, then the component returns null if not visible.

Please click on any event marker. The event detail panel should now:
? Open properly when you click an event
? Hide the navigation bar completely without flicker
? Show debug logs confirming navigation is hidden

The panel should work normally while keeping the navigation bar hidden.

I can see from the logs that the event is being selected correctly (?? Home: Evento seleccionado: and ?? Home: detailSheetVisible set to true), but I notice there are no ?? EventDetailSheet: visibility changed debug logs, which means the EventDetailSheet component is not running its useEffect.

Let me check what's happening. The issue might be that the EventDetailSheet is not receiving the visible=true prop correctly. Looking at the logs, I can see ?? BottomNav: isNavigationVisible = true which means the navigation is still visible, so the EventDetailSheet is not calling hideNavigation().

Let me add more debugging to see what's happening with the EventDetailSheet:


Edited client/src/components/events/event-detail-sheet.tsx

Each checkpoint you see here represents a complete snapshot of your project at that moment, files and databases included. If the Agent makes changes you don't like, you can go back to any checkpoint.
I added comprehensive debugging to understand why the EventDetailSheet isn't opening. Please click on any event marker now.

You should see these debug messages:

"?? EventDetailSheet: Component rendered with visible = [true/false]"
"?? EventDetailSheet: visibility changed, visible = [true/false]"
"?? EventDetailSheet: Early return - visible = [true/false]"
This will show exactly what props the EventDetailSheet is receiving and why it's not rendering the panel.
