I can see from the development context that there's an ongoing issue with the event detail panel not opening when clicking on event markers, and the navigation bar visibility system needs to be fixed. Let me examine the current state and resolve these issues.

Most APIs have daily or hourly usage limits that can cause your app to stop working unexpectedly. Check your API provider's documentation to understand your limits and monitor your usage to avoid surprises.
? Fixed type error in event selection handler
? Removed setTimeout delay that was preventing immediate sheet opening
? Improved navigation context logic to only hide when event is visible
? Ensured event detail sheet properly receives and processes visibility state

The event detail sheet should now open immediately when you click an event marker, and the navigation bar should be hidden while the panel is open. Can you test clicking on an event marker to see if the detail panel opens properly and the navigation disappears?

I can see the issue. The event detail sheet is not opening when clicking on markers, even though the debug indicator shows "sheet visible: true". This means the event is being selected but the EventDetailSheet component isn't rendering properly. Let me examine and fix this issue.

Note whether errors happen when the page loads, when you click something, or when data is being saved. Helping the Agent understand the timing helps narrow down the cause.

? Fixed all type errors in EventDetailSheet component ? Restructured component to properly handle navigation visibility ? Ensured component renders correctly when event is selected ? Fixed variable references throughout the component Now when you click on an event marker, the detail panel should open immediately and the navigation bar should be completely hidden. Can you test clicking on any event marker to see if the detail sheet opens properly and the navigation disappears?

I can see the issue! The React component is throwing a "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error, which means the hooks are being called conditionally. This is a critical React error that's causing the entire screen to go white when clicking on markers. The problem is that I moved the early return after some hooks were declared, which violates the Rules of Hooks. Let me fix this immediately:

When something doesn't work in preview, describe exactly what you expected vs. what happened. Specific feedback helps the Agent fix issues faster.
? Fixed critical React hooks error that was causing white screen
? Moved early return before all hooks to follow Rules of Hooks
? Updated EventDetailSheet component structure properly
? Navigation visibility now controlled correctly

The white screen issue should now be resolved. Please try clicking on any event marker again to see if the event detail panel opens properly without breaking the app.

I can see the issue! The event detail panel is opening correctly now, but the navigation bar is still visible at the bottom. Looking at the logs, I can see: - `EventDetailSheet: Component rendered with visible = true` - `BottomNav: isNavigationVisible = true` (should be false) The navigation visibility isn't being properly controlled. Let me fix this by checking the navigation context and ensuring it properly hides when the event sheet is visible.

Use the visual editor to select any element to give the Agent specific context, or make changes directly in the preview pane for instant results.
? Fixed navigation bar visibility issue
? Added proper navigation context integration to Home component
? Updated event detail sheet close handlers to restore navigation
? Added cleanup effects to ensure navigation shows when component unmounts

The navigation bar should now properly hide when the event detail panel opens and restore when it closes. Please try clicking on an event marker again - the navigation bar at the bottom should completely disappear while the event panel is open.

I can see the issue! The navigation is hiding for 1 second and then showing again because there's a race condition. Looking at the logs: - `EventDetailSheet: Component rendered with visible = true` - `BottomNav: isNavigationVisible = true` (should be false) The problem is that the EventDetailSheet's useEffect to hide navigation is running, but then something is immediately calling showNavigation again. Let me check what's causing this and fix it.

Data persistence means your app remembers information between visits - like user logins, saved posts, or preferences. Without a database, users would lose everything each time they refresh the page.
? Simplified navigation control logic in EventDetailSheet
? Removed conflicting useEffect hooks that caused race conditions
? Fixed cleanup handlers to properly restore navigation
? Removed duplicate showNavigation calls from Home component

The navigation should now hide immediately when you open an event detail panel and stay hidden until you close it. Please try clicking on an event marker to test - the navigation bar should disappear instantly and stay hidden while the panel is open.

quizas esto ayude para solucionarlo, quizas hacerlo por jerarquia??, fijate

Excellent analysis! You're absolutely right about the hierarchy issue. The problem is that I'm unmounting/remounting the navbar component instead of just controlling its visibility. Let me implement the CSS-based approach with proper z-index hierarchy.

? Fixed navigation bar visibility with CSS transform instead of unmounting component
? Navigation now slides down smoothly when event panels open
? Set proper z-index hierarchy - event panels (z-9999) above navigation (z-50)
? Eliminated race conditions by keeping navbar in DOM with visibility control

The navigation bar should now stay hidden while event panels are open without any flickering. Please test clicking on an event marker - the navigation should slide down smoothly and stay hidden until you close the panel.

perfecto, ahora pone el panel de mensajes con un z index mas alto al del panel de detalles del evento para que cuando se abre el panel de chat del evento desde el panel de detalle del evento, el panel de mensajes se ponga por encima del panel de detalles de evento, tambien quiero que borres todo rastro de esa etiqueta roja que exista en la app, esa etiqueta roja que dice "sheet visible: true" es inutil y no la quiero en la app

Perfect! I'll fix both issues: increase the z-index of the chat panel to be above the event detail panel, and remove that red debug label.


Opened client/src/pages/Home.tsx

Agent ran into an error
Perfect! I found the debug label. Now let me remove it and also find the chat component to increase its z-index:


Edited client/src/pages/Home.tsx

Searched for "Find the chat panel component that opens from the event detail sheet to increase its z-index above the event detail panel"

Searched for ""
Great! I found the chat component has z-[70] but the event detail sheet has z-[9999], so the chat panel is actually behind the event detail. Let me increase the chat panel's z-index:


Edited client/src/components/chat/chat.tsx

Each checkpoint you see here represents a complete snapshot of your project at that moment, files and databases included. If the Agent makes changes you don't like, you can go back to any checkpoint.
? Removed the red debug label "Sheet visible: true" from the app
? Increased chat panel z-index to z-99999 (higher than event detail panel z-9999)
? Chat panel will now properly appear above the event detail panel

The red debug label has been completely removed and the chat panel should now properly layer above the event detail panel when opened. Please test opening an event and then clicking the chat button to verify the layering works correctly.
