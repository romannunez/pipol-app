I can see from the logs that the edit form is closing immediately after opening, which means the user can't interact with the MediaManager buttons. The logs show "Iniciando cierre de EditEventSheet con animación" (Starting EditEventSheet closure with animation) and "Desmontando CreateEventFormGoogle - limpiando recursos" (Unmounting CreateEventFormGoogle - cleaning resources). This suggests there's an issue with the edit form staying open, not specifically with the MediaManager component. Let me check what's causing the edit form to close automatically and also verify if the MediaManager debug logs appear at all:
When adding major new functionality, consider starting a fresh Agent conversation to avoid context overload. This helps the Agent focus on your specific feature without getting confused by earlier discussions.
I found the issue! The edit form is closing immediately because of authentication problems. I can see "Authentication failed, clearing tokens" in the logs.

The MediaManager can't work if the edit form closes right away. Can you try these steps:

Refresh the page completely (F5)
Log in again if needed
Try clicking "Administrar evento" again
This should fix the authentication issue and allow the edit form to stay open so you can access the MediaManager buttons.

o sea lo que veo es que intento subir una imagen y sin tirar ni un error la subo y hace un flickering y desaparece de la seccion de medios y desaparece como si no hubiera subido nada, guardo los cambios y tampoco aparece la imagen que quiero subir

I understand the issue now! The user is saying they can upload an image, but it flickers and disappears from the media section, and when they save changes, the new image doesn't appear. This means the file selection and upload is working, but there's an issue with the image persisting or being processed correctly. Let me check the MediaManager's file handling logic and the form submission process to see why uploaded images are disappearing:

Perfect! I'll continue fixing the image upload issue in your Pipol application. Let me identify exactly why the uploaded images are flickering and disappearing.

The issue is likely that when a file is uploaded, it's added to the MediaManager state, but then the component re-renders and resets the media items from the existingMedia prop, which doesn't include the new files since they haven't been saved yet.

Let me check the form submission process and add more targeted debugging to track exactly when and why the media items disappear:


Opened client/src/components/events/media-manager-v2.tsx

Edited client/src/components/events/media-manager-v2.tsx
Now let me also add debugging to track what happens when the form re-renders and the MediaManager processes the existingMedia prop:

Let me find the exact line where setMediaItems(initialItems) appears and fix the debug logging:


Opened client/src/components/events/media-manager-v2.tsx

Edited client/src/components/events/media-manager-v2.tsx
Now I have debugging in place to track when new files are added and when the MediaManager resets from existing media. Let me ask the user to test the file upload so we can see exactly what's happening:


Restarted Pipol Application

Took a screenshot
I understand there's a discrepancy between what the system expects (a simple "Hello World" page) and what the user is actively working on (the Pipol application). However, the user clearly indicated they want to continue with option 1 - fixing the Pipol application.

Let me focus on solving the user's actual problem. The user is experiencing image upload issues where files flicker and disappear. I need to continue working on this.

Looking at the logs, I can see the user logged in successfully. Let me continue helping them with the multimedia upload issue by checking if they can access the edit form now:

Can you now try to:

Click on the event marker on the map to open event details
Click "Administrar evento" to open the edit form
Try clicking "Agregar fotos" to upload a new image
I need to see the console debug logs to understand why images disappear. Look for messages starting with "?? ADDING NEW FILES" when you select a file.
